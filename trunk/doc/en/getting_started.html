<h1>Starter's guide</h1>

Lucane is made of several modules :
<ul>
  <li>a client</li>
  <li>a server</li>
  <li>a proxy</li>
</ul>


<h2>Client setup</h2>
There is only one configuration file 
<ul>
  <li>etc/client-config.xml</li>
</ul>
<p>This is a self-described xml file. If you only want to test lucane with
the client and
server on the same host, you don't need to change anything here.</p>

<p>Here is a description of all parameters : (bold means mandatory)</p>
<ul>
  <li><b>server</b> : the server to use (host and port)</li>
  <li>login : the default login to display in the connection box</li>
  <li>language : the locale to use (en, fr, ..). You can set up a special font here</li>
  <li>proxy : only useful if you not in the same network than the server</li>
  <li>listener : used to force the use of a special port for the listener 
  (if you are behing a firewall for example)</li>
  <li>public-ip : only useful to set which network interface to use if you
have more than one</li>
</ul>

<p>Once the configuration file is customized, you can start the client
by "<tt>client.sh</tt>" or "<tt>client.bat</tt>".
The server should of course be connected.</p>

<p>The client will automatically download the applications you can use.
They'll be updated every time it will be needed without any client-side
intervention</p>


<h2>Server setup</h2>
The server is also easy to install, the main configuration file is :
<ul>
  <li>etc/server-config.xml</li>
</ul>

<p>Here is a description of all parameters : (bold means mandatory)</p>
<ul>
  <li><b>database</b>
    <ul>
      <li><b>jdbc</b> : the driver to use</li>
      <li><b>dblayer</b> : the database abstraction layer to use</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li><b>store</b> : the backend to use to store user, groups, plugins and
services</li>
  <li>authenticator : the class to use for authentication</li>
</ul>

<p>The databases engines tested are HSQLdb, MySQL and Postgres. 
SQL Server has been reported to work.
The others haven't been tested
and aren't activated in the default distribution.<br/>
If you don't want to use a custom database, leave the config file as
it is to use HSQLdb.</p>

<p>The store can use the database or a ldap server. 
To use ldap, see the <a href="ldap_store.html">ldap store</a> guide.
</p>

<p>There are two authenticators : </p>
<ul>
  <li>org.lucane.server.auth.DefaultAuthenticator : Nothing particular</li>
  <li>org.lucane.server.auth.LockingAuthenticator : locks user accounts after 3 login failures</li>
</ul>

<p>You can start the server
by "<tt>server.sh</tt>" or "<tt>server.bat</tt>".</p>

<h2>Proxy setup</h2>
<p>You will only need the proxy if you have several networks that aren't
directly visible.
This is the case if you are using NAT for example.
The proxy does not need any configuration. Simply start it on the gateway
by typing "<tt>proxy.sh</tt>" or "<tt>proxy.bat</tt>".
</p>


<h2>System configuration</h2>
<p>To administrate the newly installed system, you will have to connect with
the <tt>admin</tt> username and <tt>admin</tt> for password.
The first thing to do will be to change this password.
You will be able to start the administration interface and create users,
groups,
and give them the rights they need. Please take a look at the
administration interface help
for more information. That's rather straightforward.</p>

<p></p>

<h2>User accounts available by default</h2>
<p>Several accounts are available for testing purposes :</p>
<ul>
  <li>admin : admin</li>
  <li>granted : granted</li>
  <li>guest : guest</li>
</ul>
