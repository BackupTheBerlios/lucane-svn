<h1>Using LDAP for store backend</h1>

<h2>What is the store ?</h2>
<p>Lucane handles users, groups, plugins and services. 
These elements are called 'concepts'. Access management is represented 
as links between groups and other concepts.<br/>
These concepts and links are used internally as objects, which have
to be stored somewhere : database, ldap, ...<br/>
To sum up, the store is the persistance layer between Lucane concepts.</p>

<h2>Why use LDAP for the store ?</h2>
<p>If you want to use the same user accounts for multiple programs, LDAP is
probably a good idea. If you only want to use Lucane, you'd better use to the
database backend.</p>

<h2>How to configure the LDAP backend ?</h2>
<p>First, set the backend to 'ldap' in server-config.xml.<br/>
The configuration file for the ldap backend is ldap-store.xml</p>
<p>Set your ldap server in the 'url' attribute.<br/>
You have to change the authentication tag to set your bind-dn and password.</p>
<p>Each concept has the same configuration structure :</p>
<ul>
  <li>dn : the ldap path to access the concept root</li>
  <li>attributes : the static attributes to set to newly created concepts</li>
  <li>mapping : the mapping between a concept attribute in Lucane and a field in LDAP</li>
</ul>
<p>Using this mapping, we don't need a custom schema.</p>

<h2>Generating initial structure</h2>
<p>A default ldif is available : <a href="init-ldap.ldif">init-ldap.ldif</a></p>
<p>You will have to edit this ldif to match your directory structure.</p>
