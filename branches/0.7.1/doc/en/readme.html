<h2>What is Lucane ?</h2>
<p>Lucane is a free groupware platform written in Java, designed with extensibilty in mind.</p>

<p>Some applications are bundled with the platform :</p>
<ul>
    <li>A peer to peer quick message service</li>
    <li>Client/Server and peer to peer file sharing</li>

</ul>

<p>The platform as a whole provides an ease of development for your networked applications :</p>
<ul>
    <li>Object based network protocol</li>
    <li>Client/Server and peer to peer</li>
    <li>User and groups management with an abstract Store system</li>
    <li>Multi Language system</li>

<h2>What is a groupware ?</h2>
<p>A groupware is a program that allows several people to work together 
in a simpler and more productive way than only using email. A groupware 
is strongly network oriented and provides some tools making it possible to 
distant people to communicate in a synchronous or asynchronous way. For example, 
it will be possible for users to share files, or even to store them on a server and 
to work with them at the same time. A lot of tools can be integrated in a groupware. 
That's why it is so important to remain extensible.
